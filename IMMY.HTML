      I always thought my dream was to be a
      teacher for a little primary school,
      sipping my idea and reading the pening
      lines to the next best-progressing schools.
      It seemed like an appropriate dream given my ffluency in English.
      I gravitated toward teaching and quality control positions and 
      even started my own home kindergarten with my siblings.
      But i kind of just felt meh.
      I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something new and different.
    </p>
      
 <p>
      And that's when it happened;the spark i was missing ignitted 
      the instant i clicked play on my first web page development practice .
      I mean seriously, how could it not be great 
      when it's a language Since then, I can't get enough.
      Front-end web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates
      creativity and problem solving and i'm allowed to break it to 
      improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).

        I love applying responsive design principles and watching
        my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing.
        It's oodly satisfying.
        I think in a way i'm kind of like those web pages ;
        i'm moldable, but still keep my creative flare intact.
   </p>
          
    <p>
      My specialties include quickly learning new
      skills and programming languages, problem solving, 
      responsive design principles, website optimisation, And
      the methods of oranising codes.
