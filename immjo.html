			I was born on a cold, cloudy day in October in Lugazi, Buikwe district.
			I still stay in Lugazi but currently in Namungoona and go to school at
			<b>Makerere Institute for Social Development</b>.I live with my family .when i was born,
			my elders were of good age meaning they would do anything for me.They are really 
			sweet family to me but like all other brothers and sisters we fight but like cats and dogs.
			 Sometimes when no one was home they would scar me alot with no any good reason
			but still love them because they are my family.

	what life means to me
</h2> 

			<p>

				Life to me means friends and family who you can trust and who trusta you.
				I am pretty much on the 
				happy side of life, but like all teens i do have my "days of."
				That means i do have some sad days of depressed days.I have a few friends here that sort 
				of look out for me and when i am having a bad day, I have some one here at school to talk to.
				I make my school days go by thinking of either the next hour or i will do when i get home
				or on a werekend.In my lesure time, i like going out for ventures and in amusement
				parks which are one of my favorite
				places and sometimes when with friends, we go together for beach, movies, 
				games and sports and dinner
