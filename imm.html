		As a student at <B>Makerere Institute For Social Development </B> (MISD)
		I have become 
		increasingly aware of the complex network problems 
		that i face  as a citizen 
		of the world. I have also realised the progress and success 
		that i enjoy in the same capacity
		as the frontiers of Information, Communication Technology 
		and Webpage developers  to continue to expand.
		My desire to participate in the resolution of those 
		problems and in the further expansion 
		of those frontiers had inspired me to seek a
		certificate in IT into this institute.
		I intend to successfully complete program of 
		it and further my specialisation in the area of technology.
		Upon completion of my certificate programs i would like to 
		remain in the central region of my country to
		make services availble to the underserved populations
		of the area. I would also like to spend sometime serving
		the populations of eastern, western where i would gain
		invaluable experience and provide the much needed services
		of a specialist.

	<p>
		My desire to enter the field of <B>INFORMATION TECHNOLOY</B> has
		grown as i've participated with professional web developers in 
		the field and observed  wide range of procedures.My interest in
		it started way back when i was involved in computer application
		before undergoing proper application. I gained a deep appreciation
		and understanding of what people in need of such services are 
		experiencing, as well as a great respect and administration for the
		professionals of that field. Through the practice of microsoft 
		word processing, i desire to have a positive supportive impact on
		the lives of those i serve, as i experienced in my own life through
		my lecturers of <b>microsoft word processing. </b> 
		I also desireto be a respected, contributing member of the community, 
		and i feel that the field of IT will afford me
		 such opportunities as i participate in it.
 </p>
 
 <p>
		I will be successfull in my <b> information technology</b> school
		because of my dedication to the pursuit of academic excellence and
		my desire to succeed.
		I have gained experiencein public speaking through my various service and 
		academic  activities and enjoy meeting and dealing with people,
		which will serve me in it institute and 
		as a professional web developer.
		I have increased my fine motor skills and manual dexterity through my 
		study of keyboard which will also   aide me in pursuit 
		of a DDS certificate. My service as a missionary
		situations.
		I strugled and succeded in my search for ways to
		 serve and help  people in a languagge,
		 land and culture that was not mine
		those experiences have given me needed skills 
		and attributes to become a successful servant of the community
		and participate in the field of my interest.
	</p>

<p>
		I have repeatedly shown my determination in the environment of the institute as 
		i have faced and conquered.
		I am successful to the institute after my two 
		year staying at home because of <b>COVID-19</b>  have been successful
		each semester Since
		 in maintaining my bursary.I have maintained my academic standing as i take full
		loads of course  work and hold employment
		outside of class as well as sustain my family.
		I feel that i have been able to accomplish this because of the balance
		i seek as i participate in the academic, spiritual, social and family spheres of my life.
